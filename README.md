# macOS Portfolio

## Inspiration
I drew inspiration from a portfolio I saw on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8BkgYnk/) _(right-click → “Open in new tab”)_.

Researched existing open source macOS portfolios:  
- [playground-macos](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos) _(open in new tab)_  
- [danielprior-macos](https://github.com/daprior/danielprior-macos/) _(open in new tab)_
